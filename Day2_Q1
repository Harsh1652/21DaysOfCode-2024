Question 1:
A professor has a class of students and wants to know if the class should be cancelled based on student arrival times. The class is cancelled if fewer than a threshold number of students arrive on time.
Inputs:
An integer representing the threshold number of students.
An array of integers representing arrival times, where a non-positive integer indicates on-time arrival. Output:
YES" if the class is cancelled, "NO" otherwise.
Example:
threshold = 3

arrival_times = [-1, -3, 4, 2]

Output: YES
